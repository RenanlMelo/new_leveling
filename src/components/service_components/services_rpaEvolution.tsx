        The Evolution of RPA
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 tracking-wide">
        At <strong>Leveling</strong>, we take RPA to the next level by
        integrating it with
        <strong> Artificial Intelligence</strong>,
        <strong> Machine Learning</strong>, and
        <strong> Process Mining</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 tracking-wide">
        This allows us to create intelligent automations that go far beyond
        executing repetitive tasks — they <strong>analyze data</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>make decisions</strong>, and{" "}
        <strong>continuously improve workflows</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 tracking-wide">
        Our approach follows the concept of <strong>Hyperautomation</strong>: a
        powerful blend of technologies that automates entire workflows from
        start to finish.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 tracking-wide">
        The result? <strong>More productivity</strong>,
        <strong>fewer errors</strong>, and{" "}
        <strong>more time for your team to focus on what truly matters</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="tracking-wide">
        With <strong>Leveling</strong>, automation becomes a
        <strong> strategic advantage</strong> — powered by real intelligence and
        built for the future.
